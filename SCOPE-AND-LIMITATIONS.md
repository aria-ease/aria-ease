# Scope and Limitations

## Our Commitment to Transparency

**Aria-Ease is powerful, but it's not a complete accessibility solution on its own.**

We believe the biggest problem in accessibility tooling isn't a lack of tools—it's a lack of transparency about what those tools actually cover. Too many tools present themselves as comprehensive solutions without clearly communicating their limitations. This leads to false confidence, missed issues, and real legal/ethical consequences.

**We're different. We're honest about what we do AND what we don't do.**

---

## ✅ What Aria-Ease DOES Cover

Aria-Ease provides **production-ready accessibility utilities** for common interactive patterns. We handle the complex, repetitive technical implementation so you don't have to.

### Component Patterns (7 Core)

We provide full WCAG-compliant implementations for:

- ✅ **Menu / Dropdowns** - Navigation menus, user profile dropdowns, context menus
- ✅ **Accordion** - Expandable sections, FAQs, collapsible content
- ✅ **Checkbox Groups** - Multi-select options with keyboard interaction
- ✅ **Radio Button Groups** - Single-select options with arrow key navigation
- ✅ **Toggle Buttons** - On/off switches, settings toggles
- ✅ **Combobox** - Autocomplete, search with suggestions, editable dropdowns
- ✅ **Block Navigation** - Landmark region navigation (skip links)

### Technical Implementation

For each pattern, Aria-Ease automatically handles:

- ✅ **Keyboard Interaction**
  - Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →)
  - Tab/Shift+Tab
  - Enter and Space activation
  - Escape to close/cancel
  - Home/End for first/last item

- ✅ **ARIA Attributes**
  - Roles (`role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"`, etc.)
  - States (`aria-expanded`, `aria-checked`, `aria-selected`)
  - Properties (`aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-haspopup`)
  - Relationships (`aria-owns`, `aria-describedby`)

- ✅ **Focus Management**
  - Focus trapping (for modals and menus)
  - Focus restoration (return to trigger element)
  - Visible focus indicators (CSS support)
  - Logical focus order
  - First/last item navigation

- ✅ **State Management**
  - Component state tracking
  - Event handling
  - Cleanup on unmount
  - Dynamic content updates (via `refresh()` methods)

### Standards Compliance

- ✅ Based on **WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)**
- ✅ **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliant for covered patterns
- ✅ Follows **established interaction patterns** from W3C
- ✅ **Keyboard-first** approach (not mouse-dependent)

### Testing Tools

- ✅ **Contract Testing Framework** - Validate component behavior
- ✅ **CLI Audit Tool** - Powered by axe-core for automated scanning
- ✅ **Component-Specific Tests** - Pre-built test suites
- ✅ **Playwright Integration** - Browser-based testing

---

## ❌ What Aria-Ease DOES NOT Cover

**This is equally important.** Aria-Ease is part of a complete accessibility strategy, not the entire strategy.

### Visual & Design Accessibility

- ❌ **Typography** - Font size, line height, letter spacing
- ❌ **Visual Layout** - Reading order, visual hierarchy
- ❌ **Responsive Design** - Mobile accessibility, touch targets
- ❌ **CSS Styling** - You control all visual presentation
- ❌ **Animation/Motion** - `prefers-reduced-motion`, animation safety

**Why:** Aria-Ease handles JavaScript behavior and ARIA semantics. Visual accessibility requires design decisions we can't automate.

**Use Instead:** Lighthouse, axe DevTools, WAVE, manual design review

---

### Content Accessibility

- ❌ **Alternative Text** - Image alt text, decorative vs informative
- ❌ **Link Text** - Descriptive link text vs "click here"
- ❌ **Form Labels** - `<label>` associations, placeholders vs labels
- ❌ **Error Messages** - Clear, actionable error descriptions
- ❌ **Instructions** - Help text, required field indicators
- ❌ **Language** - `lang` attribute, plain language, readability
- ❌ **Tables** - `<th>`, `scope`, `<caption>` for data tables
- ❌ **Lists** - Semantic `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>` markup

**Why:** Content accessibility requires human judgment about context, clarity, and meaning.

**Use Instead:** Manual content review, plain language experts, content accessibility guidelines

---

### Multimedia & Documents

- ❌ **Video Captions** - Closed captions, subtitles, transcripts
- ❌ **Audio Descriptions** - Descriptive narration for visual content
- ❌ **Transcripts** - Text alternatives for audio/video
- ❌ **PDF Accessibility** - Tagged PDFs, reading order
- ❌ **Documents** - Word docs, PowerPoint, Excel accessibility

**Why:** These require specialized tools and manual creation.

**Use Instead:** Dedicated caption services, document remediation tools, manual creation

---

### Custom & Complex Patterns

- ❌ **Custom Widgets** - Patterns not in our 7 core components
- ❌ **Data Tables** - Sortable, filterable, complex tables
- ❌ **Rich Text Editors** - Complex WYSIWYG interfaces
- ❌ **Drag-and-Drop** - Accessible drag interfaces with keyboard
- ❌ **Charts/Graphs** - Data visualization accessibility
- ❌ **Maps** - Interactive map accessibility
- ❌ **Carousels** - Image carousels, slideshows
- ❌ **Tabs** - Tabbed interfaces (coming soon)
- ❌ **Modals/Dialogs** - Alert dialogs, confirmations (coming soon)
- ❌ **Tooltips** - Hover/focus tooltips (coming soon)

**Why:** We focus on doing 7 patterns exceptionally well. Custom patterns need custom solutions.

**Use Instead:** Build using WAI-ARIA APG as reference, or wait for us to add support

---

### Assistive Technology Testing

- ❌ **Screen Reader Testing** - How content sounds in NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- ❌ **Announcement Behavior** - What gets read and when
- ❌ **Voice Control** - Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Voice Control
- ❌ **Magnification** - ZoomText, OS magnification
- ❌ **Switch Access** - Single-switch, multi-switch navigation
- ❌ **Eye Tracking** - Gaze-based interaction

**Why:** These require actual assistive technology and human testing. No automated tool can fully replicate this.

**Use Instead:** Manual testing with real assistive technology, user testing with disabled users

---

### Browser & Platform Compatibility

- ❌ **Cross-Browser Edge Cases** - Rare browser-specific bugs
- ❌ **Legacy Browser Support** - IE11, very old browsers
- ❌ **Mobile Touch Patterns** - Touch-specific interactions (primarily keyboard-focused)
- ❌ **Platform-Specific AT** - iOS VoiceOver gestures, Android TalkBack nuances

**Why:** We test on modern browsers, but edge cases exist. Mobile touch patterns need dedicated research.

**Use Instead:** Cross-browser testing, real device testing, mobile-specific accessibility patterns

---

### Organizational & Process

- ❌ **Policy Development** - Creating accessibility policies
- ❌ **VPAT/ACR Creation** - Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates
- ❌ **Legal Compliance** - Legal review, ADA expertise

**Why:** These are human services, not technical tools.

**Use Instead:** Accessibility consultants, legal counsel, training programs

---

## 🔁 What STILL Requires Manual Testing

Even after implementing Aria-Ease correctly, you should manually test:

### Critical Manual Tests

1. **Screen Reader Experience**
   - Navigate with NVDA (Windows)
   - Navigate with JAWS (Windows)
   - Navigate with VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
   - Navigate with TalkBack (Android)
   - Verify announcements make sense
   - Check for redundant or confusing output

2. **Keyboard-Only Navigation**
   - Unplug your mouse
   - Navigate through entire interface
   - Verify nothing is unreachable
   - Check focus is always visible
   - Test logical tab order

3. **Context-Specific Validation**
   - Do error messages make sense?
   - Are instructions clear?
   - Is the user flow logical?
   - Are labels descriptive enough?
   - Do tooltips provide helpful information?

4. **Real User Testing**
   - Test with actual disabled users
   - Observe pain points
   - Gather feedback
   - Iterate based on real usage

### Why Manual Testing Matters

**Automated tools (including Aria-Ease) catch ~30-40% of accessibility issues.**

The remaining 60-70% require human judgment:

- Is this label meaningful in context?
- Is the error message helpful?
- Does the tab order make logical sense?
- Are announcements clear without visual context?
- Does this work for my users' actual needs?

**Aria-Ease makes your automated 30-40% rock solid. You still need to handle the other 60-70%.**
